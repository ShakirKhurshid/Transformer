Working :
An image is fed to the program, it reads the image and does some basic preprocessing to get a crisp and high contrast mage for easy number plate recognition.The it detects the number plate using Countours, an then using the transform function, it straightens the license plate if the license plate is tilted. 

this can be also used to detect and straighten documentents, it will give a top down view of the documents
